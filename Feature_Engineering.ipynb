        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        ">>  Parameter is a variable that is learned during model training process in machine learning. It is used to represents the relationship in the data and to make predictions on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation? What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        ">> Correlation refers to the linear relationship between variables. A negative correlation means that if one variable increases then the other variable decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        ">> Machine learning is a branch of aritificial intelligence that helps machine to learn and find patterns on their own using data. Main components of machine learning are: Data, Models, Algorithms and Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        ">>  Loss values help find out how much the preditictions varies from the actual outcomes. Thus if loss value is high then the model is not good, lower loss values means model is more robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        ">> Continuous variables are numeric values which can take any value on a scale. Example are height, distance. Categorical variables are non numeric variables such as gender, grade or color.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        ">> Categorical variables are handled by denoting them with a numeric value using different encoding techniques. Some common techniques are Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, Target based encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        ">> When developing a machine learning model the model needs some information or data to analyse it and find out patterns in order to make decisions and predictions on it own. The training step helps model to determine some patterns on the data while testing comes later to eavaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        ">> Scikit learn is a widely used machine learning library containing modules such as preprocessing which is used to for different feature engineering techniques such as data encoding, scaling or imputation.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a Test set?\n",
        ">> Test set is some part of data which is not used for model training and is reserved for model testing purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        ">> Different methods such as `train_test_split()` are used for splitting data in some ratios for training and testing model. Majority of the data is used for taining while remaining is used to test the model. There are several steps involved in aprroaching machine learning problem: Defining the probel > Collect data > Clean and process the data > Split into test/train > Train model > Evaluate the model > Tuning the model > Deployment\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        ">> EDA also exploratory data analysis is performed to learn and summarize the characteristics of the data, detect outliers and anomalies, find out patterns and deal with missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is correlation?\n",
        ">> Correlation refers to the linear realtionship between variables in a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        ">> Negative correlation means that the variables are inversely related meaning increase in one variable lead to decrease in the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        ">> Correlation can be measure in python using pandas dataframes or numpy function also using libraries such as scipy.stats.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        ">> Causation means having a causal relationship. For example rain causes flood or sunrise causes day. While correlation doesn't imply causation for example increase in umbrella sales in a region during summer season might be because of summer or there might be some sale going on.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
        ">> An optimizer is an alogrithm that adjusts the parameters or weights of a model to reduce the loss during training.\n",
        " >> Different types of optimizers are:\n",
        "\n",
        " >> Gradient Descent: adjusting parameters of a loss function to minimise the loss.\n",
        "\n",
        " >> Adaptive Optimizers: Adapt the learning rate of each parameter based on its historical gradient information.\n",
        "\n",
        " >> Momentum: Accelerate convergence and reach minimum faster by learning on previous gradients\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is sklearn.linear_model?\n",
        ">> Sklearn.liner_model is a scikit learn module containing different linear modles such as linear regression, logistic regrssion, ridge etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        ">> `model.fit` is used to train the model and fit it as per training the dataset. It requires arguments such x_train and y_train to accept training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        ">> `model.predict` is used to make prediction on test data after training the model. It requires test data as arguments to make prediction and test the accuracy of the model.\n",

        "\n",
        "21. What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n",
        ">> Feature scaling is a process to standardize data in machine learning to a common scale or range. It helps by increasing model accuracy and performance due to standardisation of the features and giving them equal treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. How do we perform scaling in Python?\n",
        ">> There are different ways to do scaling. We can use standarscaler to standardize as per the standard normal distribution. MinMaxScaler is used to scale data on the basis of minimum and maximum value while normalizer can be used to transform data into unit vectors.\n",

        ">> `test_train_split()` from sklearn.model is used to divide data into training data and testing data so that model can train on the training data and its accuracy can be tested on the testing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  \n",

        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        ">> OOP is a programming concept where classes and objects are used to store attributes and methods making a program efficient and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        ">> Class is a blueprint or template used to create different objects and define different attributes and methods associated with them.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        ">> Objects are instances of a class used to store specific data and perform actions defined by their class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        ">> Abstraction in python is a concept to hide unneccessary details and showing relevant information to users. It is used by defining abstractmethod and hiding the actual methods. While encapsulation is a way to protect certain attributes and variables from users to maintain data integrity. It is used by creating private and public methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        ">> Dunder methods or magic methods also known as special methods are built-in methods used to perform special operations. They end and start with duble underscore hence know as dunder methods. Examples are `__init__`, `__str__`, `__call__` etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        ">> Inheritance is a concept in OOP used to define relationship across classes by establishing parent and child class. The attributes and methods defined within a parent class are inherited by a child class promoting reusability of methods and attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        ">> Polymorphism means different forms. It allows same method names or operations to behave differently depending on the object using it.\n",
        "\n",
        "            class Animal:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        ">> Encapsualtion in python helps in hiding attributes defined inside a class. This is done by defining private or public attributes. It is achieved by fixing underscores at the start of an attribute name. Single underscore (`_variable_name`) means it is a protected attribute specifing that it should not be accessed directly from outside the class. While double underscore (`__variable_name` ) means it is a private attribute and can't be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        ">> A constructor is a special method in python used to initialize objects when they are created. It is used to pass values and making them ready for use.\n",

        "                #syntax of a constructor\n",
        "                def __init__(self,*args):\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        ">> Class method is defined by using `@classmethod` and fixing `cls` as first parameter instead of `self` while defining the method. It can access and modify class level attributes. Static methods are defined using `@staticmethod` and doesn't require any necessaary parameter as used by class and instance method. It is used to define utility function which can't interact with class level data and mainly used as helper functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        ">> Method overloading means defining functions with same name but different parameters in the same class. Python doesn't support true method overloading but there are way arounds to achieve it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "          class Maths:\n",

        "          \n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        ">> Method overriding refers to overriding the methods of a prent class while defining methods with similar name but modified function inside a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "          #example of method overriding\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        ">> Property decorators in python allows you to define a method in class which can be called as an attribute. It means you don't have to close the function with parenthesis while calling it. It defined using `@property` kewyword and can bue to define setter or deleter.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        ">> Polymorphism allows you to use same function differently depending on the object on which it is called. It gives flexibility and extensibility to the code without writing long codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        ">> Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly but are meant to be  inherited by a child class. Thus giving common interface to subclass and methods which they have to implemet maintiang uniformity across the class objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        ">> There are several advantages of OOP. It can help create different classe with similar undelrying attrbutes and methods while at the same time maintaining flexibiltiy or extensibility by allowing to override the methods of the inherited class. It helps in organizing large code under a common class and making it resuable for further requirements. It also helps in encapsulation meaning can help in protecting the state or data of a class maintaing data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        ">> Instance variable are defined by fixing `self` as first parameter while defining them. These methods are defined for the particular objects. While class methods are defined for entire class and can't be instantiated. These varaible defined under this method share same data across different ojects until overwridden.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        ">> Mutliple inheritance allows same child class to inherit from more than one parent class. Similar methods will be overriden by the first parent class specified in the parameter. This helps in taking data from mutliple classes and reusing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__`  methods in Python?\n",
        ">> `__str__` and `__repr__` both are special methods in python used to represent string data. `__str__` provide a human readable form of string which can be accessed using `print()`. While `__repr__` is used to return a more technical or formal string representation of an object. It is ideally used for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
        ">> `super()` function is used in python to as it is inherit parent attributes and methods without defining same constructor and methods for the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        ">> `__del__' method  also known as destructor is used to delete any object and its attributes.\n",

        "22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?\n",
        ">> Class method is defined by using `@classmethod` and fixing `cls` as first parameter instead of `self` while defining the method. It can access and modify class level attributes.

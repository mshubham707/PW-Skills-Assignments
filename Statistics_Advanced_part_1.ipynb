        "1. What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. It maps outcomes of a random process to real numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> There are two types: Discrete (countable outcomes) and Continuous (uncountable, measurable outcomes).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> Discrete distributions have distinct values (like integers), while continuous distributions have outcomes over a continuous range.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> A PDF describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value (or range of values).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> CDF gives the probability a variable is less than or equal to a value; PDF gives the probability density at a specific value.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> A distribution where all outcomes are equally likely and finite, such as rolling a fair die.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> It has two outcomes (0 and 1), with a single trial and probability p of success.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> It models the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability p.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> It models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time/space, with a known constant mean rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> A distribution where all values in a continuous range are equally likely, like picking a random number between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> It's symmetric, bell-shaped, centered at the mean, with most data within 3 standard deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> A normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1; it simplifies calculations in statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as sample size increases, enabling inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> CLT explains why many distributions tend to be approximately normal when averaged over large samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> Z-statistics are used to test hypotheses about population means when population variance is known.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> Z = (X - μ) / σ; it represents how many standard deviations a value X is from the mean μ.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> Point estimate gives a single value as an estimate, while interval estimate provides a range likely to contain the parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> They give a range of values which is likely to contain the population parameter with a specified confidence level.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> Z-scores determine the margin of error in confidence intervals based on the desired confidence level.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> They standardize different distributions, allowing comparison across different units and scales.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> Independent observations, identically distributed, and sufficiently large sample size (usually n > 30).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> It's the long-term average outcome of a random variable: E(X) = Σ[x * P(x)].\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",
        "\n",
        ">> The distribution defines the likelihood of outcomes, and the expected value summarizes their average effect."
